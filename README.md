# Learn-Python

First thing first, Python is hands down one of the most popular script languages out there. The reason being it is widely used in todays hot fields such as Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have prepared a single script full of of comments that you will be able to see both in the command line and in the script itself. If you can follow every line and run the program you will be able to understand which command or function is doing what!.. Enjoy
