# Learn-Python

First thing first, Python is hands down one of the most popular script languages out there. The reason being it is widely used in todays hot fields such asÂ Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have prepared a single script full of comments that you will be able to see both in the command line as well as in the script itself. If you can follow every line as you run the script, you will be able to understand inner workings of Python. Enjoy!
